# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project very seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability within our project, we kindly ask you to follow the steps below to responsibly disclose it to our team:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until it has been fixed. Public disclosure of a security issue can put the entire community at risk.

2. **Email us directly** at [security@lisk.com](mailto:security@lisk.com) with a detailed description of the issue. Please provide as much information as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue, potential impacts, and any suggestions you might have for resolving it.

3. **Give us a reasonable amount of time** to address the issue before you disclose it to others. We promise to investigate all legitimate reports and make every effort to quickly resolve any issues.

4. **Do not exploit the vulnerability** more than is necessary to prove its existence. Avoid accessing or modifying data that does not belong to you.

## Security Update Policy

When a security issue is identified and resolved, we will update the project and release a new version as promptly as possible. We will also provide a detailed report of the vulnerability, how it was addressed, and the steps we're taking to prevent similar issues in the future.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions about this policy or the security of this project, please email us at [security@lisk.com](mailto:security@lisk.com).

Thank you for helping to keep our project and the broader community safe!
